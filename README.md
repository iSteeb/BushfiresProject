Bushfire Simulator App
Bushfires Project

- [ ] Initialise with timer (final screen showing time taken) gamification
- [ ] Random chance, at every alert, that a device goes offline (may come back online?) - extended idea: random devices are either offline (no signal) or just don’t disseminate the information - same alert is presented at every stage (minus emergecy alert texts maybe)
- [ ] Prompt users with other preparedness items to escalate threat (e.g. have you cleared the gutters? If no, now you have to deal with embers).
- [ ] Roadblocks: your primary route has been blocked, do you have a secondary OR you’ve left it too late! Are you prepared?
- [ ] How to progress to next notification?
- [ ] prompt the user to think of the route they need to change it at a later stage
